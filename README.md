# OCTOPUS: Origin Computation and Tracing by Objective Phylogeny and Usable Screensaver 

<br/>


# #1. Introduction

## This tool is designed to perform like an octopus, who can "guess" the winner of football game.
## Of course, for serious scientific question of virus origin, it is based on "objective phylogeny", not "guessing".

## A default phylogeny tree is drawn and displayed. It does not change much, just like the London Eye.
## More and more virus genome data come everyday, real time. Some of these virus data might be "smoking guns" or even "bombers". When that happens, the "London Eye" will competely change and raise an alarm.

## The final product will be a "Usable Screensaver". Since the pandemic has affected everybody, we want to get the public engaged, for them to better understand how orgin tracing is done scientifically.
